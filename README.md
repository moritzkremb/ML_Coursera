# Machine Learning Course Programming Exercises

This repo contains the exercises for the Machine Learning on Coursera (by Stanford University). The upload serves as a proof of achievement as part of my coding resume. If you are a current student in the course, don't copy and go do the exercises by yourself ;)

+ Ex.1: Linear Regression
+ Ex.2: Logistic Regression
+ Ex.3: Multi-class classification
+ Ex.4: Neural Networks
+ Ex.5: Regularization & Bias vs. Variance
